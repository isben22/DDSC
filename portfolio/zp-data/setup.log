Zenphoto Setup v1.4.14[f5b47da52f]: Thu, 13 Apr 2017 22:36:25 -0500
Warn: zp-data security [is compromised] Zenphoto suggests you make the sensitive files in the zp-data folder accessable by owner only (permissions = 0600). The file permissions for setup.log are 0644 which may allow unauthorized access.
Warn: PHP gettext() support [is not present] Localization of Zenphoto requires native PHP gettext() support
Warn: The Zenphoto filesystem character define is UTF&#8209;8 [no test performed] Setup did not perform a test of the filesystem character set. You can cause setup to test for a proper definition by creating a file in your zp-data folder named charset_tÃ©st and re-running setup.If your server filesystem character set is different from UTF&#8209;8 and you create album or image filenames names containing characters with diacritical marks you may have problems with these objects.Change the filesystem character set define to Unknown	BIG5	EUC-CN	EUC-JP	EUC-KR	GB18030	GB2312	GBK	IBM437	IBM775	IBM850	IBM852	IBM857	IBM861	IBM869	ISO-2022-JP	ISO-8859-1	ISO-8859-13	ISO-8859-14	ISO-8859-15	ISO-8859-16	ISO-8859-2	ISO-8859-3	ISO-8859-5	ISO-8859-6	ISO-8859-7	ISO-8859-8	ISO-8859-9	KOI8-R	KOI8-U	SHIFT-JIS	TIS-620	US-ASCII	UTF-16	UTF-7	UTF-8	WINDOWS-1250	WINDOWS-1251	WINDOWS-1252	WINDOWS-1253	WINDOWS-1254	WINDOWS-1255	WINDOWS-1256	WINDOWS-1257	WINDOWS-1258	WINDOWS-874apply
